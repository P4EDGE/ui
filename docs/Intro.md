## What is P4Edge?

P4Edge is a low cost, open source platform for computer networks teaching and research.

The platform is based on either the Raspberry Pi board or the PC Engines XY and it uses the P4 programming language.

## Why P4Edge?

Teaching computer networks should be cool and exciting.

For students to engage with networking, we want to provide hands-on experience and hardware based projects. Unlike software-based solutions, running on actual platforms provides realism, as well as a cool factor.

Existing programmable hardware solutions are too expensive, and don't allow educators to build labs of 20+ devices, nor for students to purchase one themselves. With P4Edge, we provide a platform that is cheaper than an academic book.

## Who is P4Edge for?

P4Edge is aimed at networking educators, hobbyists and researchers.

The education materials are design for multiple university courses: from undergraduate introduction to networking course, to postgraduate advanced networking.
